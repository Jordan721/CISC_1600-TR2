		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hello, my name is Jordan Alexis and I'm a Junior Programmer and Designer. i'm just learning how to make it in this world full of many trials. I love programming, gaming, comics, and all around ok dude</p>
		
		<p>Before coming to the college that I'm at now I had a bunch of trials before me. One of them was having a college close on me without infoming us before hand. That collge was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramson_ORT_College">Bramson ORT College</a>.I was going for my assoiates in Computer Science and Game Design. After i left that collge I went to <a href="http://www.college-universities.com/school-technical-career-institute.php">TCI</a> they helped me get my credits re-evaluated, a good thing I left after one semester bacuse it closed down too. Was going there for Computer Networking.
